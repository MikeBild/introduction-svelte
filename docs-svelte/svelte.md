# What is Svelte?

- it's not a framework, it's a transpiler!
- no browser runtime and Virtual DOM diffs
- transpiler produces vanilla JavaScript at build time
- faster page load and rendering time
- supports scoped CSS and CSS Preprocessors
- best performance in Bundle Sizes, Performance, Startup Time, Build Time, Time To First Screen, ...
- supports TypeScript

## Cons?

- there is no company behind the scenes 
- comparatively to React, Angular, Vue fewer finished UI components
- bundle large external JavaScript modules can be tricky
- not (yet) an extremely large community like React
