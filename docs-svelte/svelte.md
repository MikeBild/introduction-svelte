# What is Svelte?

- It's not a framework, it's a transpiler!
- No browser runtime and Virtual DOM diffs
- Transpiler produces vanilla JavaScript at build time
- Faster page load and rendering time
- Best performance in Bundle Sizes, Performance, Startup Time, Build Time, Time To First Screen, ...
- Supports TypeScript, scoped CSS, CSS Preprocessors, etc.

## Cons?

- There is no company behind the scenes 
- Comparatively to React, Angular, Vue fewer finished UI components
- Not (yet) an extremely large community like React
